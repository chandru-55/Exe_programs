1. Write a program to solve a classic ancient Chinese puzzle: 
We count 35 heads and 94 legs among the chickens and rabbits in a farm. 
How many rabbits and how many chickens do we have?
​
Hint:
Use for loop to iterate all possible solutions.
​
​
2. Please write a program which prints all permutations of [1,2,3]
​
​
Hints:
Use itertools.permutations() to get permutations of list.
​
​
3. Please write a program which accepts a string from console and print the characters that have even indexes.
​
Example:
If the following string is given as input to the program:
​
H1e2l3l4o5w6o7r8l9d
​
Then, the output of the program should be:
​
Helloworld
​
Hints:
Use list[::2] to iterate a list by step 2.
​
​
4. Please write a program which accepts a string from console and print it in reverse order.
​
Example:
If the following string is given as input to the program:
​
rise to vote sir
​
Then, the output of the program should be:
​
ris etov ot esir
​
​
5. Please write a program which count and print the numbers of each character in a string input by console.
​
Example:
If the following string is given as input to the program:
​
abcdefgabc
​
Then, the output of the program should be:
​
a,2
c,2
b,2
e,1
d,1
g,1
f,1
​
Hints:
Use dict to store key/value pairs.
Use dict.get() method to lookup a key with default value
​
​
6. With a given list [12,24,35,24,88,120,155,88,120,155], write a program to print this list after removing all duplicate values with original order reserved.
​
Hints:
Use set() to store a number of values without duplicate.
​
​
7. By using list comprehension, please write a program to print the list after removing the value 24 in [12,24,35,24,88,120,155].
​
Hints:
Use list's remove method to delete a value.
​
8.By using list comprehension, please write a program to print the list after removing the 0th,4th,5th numbers in [12,24,35,70,88,120,155].
​
Hints:
Use list comprehension to delete a bunch of element from a list.
Use enumerate() to get (index, value) tuple.
​
9.By using list comprehension, please write a program generate a 3*5*8 3D array whose each element is 0.
​
​
10. By using list comprehension, please write a program to print the list after removing delete numbers which are divisible by 5 and 7 in [12,24,35,70,88,120,155].
​
Hints:
Use list comprehension to delete a bunch of element from a list.
​

11. 
​
Question:
Write a program which takes 2 digits, X,Y as input and generates a 2-dimensional array. The element value in the i-th row and j-th column of the array should be i*j.
Note: i=0,1.., X-1; j=0,1,¡­Y-1.
Example
Suppose the following inputs are given to the program:
3,5
Then, the output of the program should be:
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]] 
​
Hints:
Note: In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input in a comma-separated form.
