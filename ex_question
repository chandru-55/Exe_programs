Question:
With a given integral number n, write a program to generate a dictionary that contains (i, i*i) 
such that is an integral number between 1 and n (both included). and then the program should 
print the dictionary.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
8
Then, the output should be:
{1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64}
